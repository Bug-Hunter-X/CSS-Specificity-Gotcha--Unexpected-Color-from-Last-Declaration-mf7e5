The solution involves correctly understanding and applying CSS selector specificity:

```css
div {
  color: blue; /* Default color */
}

.my-class div {
  color: red;
}

#my-id div {
  color: green;
}

#my-id .my-class div {
  color: purple; /* This will override previous declarations due to high specificity */
}

/*Avoid redundant declarations, the below is unnecessary as it's less specific than previous declarations*/
/*div {
  color: yellow;
}*/
```

By understanding how specificity works, developers can avoid unexpected styling results. Ensure the most specific selectors are placed thoughtfully, in consideration of their cascading effect.
